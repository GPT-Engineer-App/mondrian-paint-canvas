# mondrian-paint-canvas

Create an app that shows a full screen drawing canvas.

I should be able to select colors and brush sizes from swatches across the bottom of the screen, showing which one is active. Make sure yo preselect a size and colour so that the user can draw without configuring anything. 

Use the famous Mondrian color palette for the colors. Paint with a round shape.
